## Lessons I learned

- Even with planning, there still is unforseen changes midway. I have a lot to learn!
- Updating state and re-rendering components is a nightmare I did not expect to meet. "Keep render logic and app logic separate", they said... They knew it all along, I suspect!
- Programming requires you to think before acting. It is easy to forget that, but I am always harshly reminded, which is good.
